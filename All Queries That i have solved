ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Q4: Which city has the best customers?
SELECT billing_city, SUM(total) AS InvoiceTotal
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_city

LIMIT 1;


-- Question Set 2 - Moderate

-- Q1: Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners.

JOIN track ON invoiceline.track_id = track.track_id
JOIN genre ON track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
WHERE genre.name = 'Rock'
ORDER BY email;

-- Q2: Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.
SELECT artist.artist_id, artist.name AS artist_name, COUNT(track.track_id) AS track_count
FROM track
JOIN album ON track.album_id = album.album_id
JOIN artist ON album.artist_id = artist.artist_id

JOIN artist_sales asa ON al.artist_id = asa.artist_id
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name, c.country, asa.artist_name, asa.total_sales
HAVING asa.total_sales = MAX(asa.total_sales)
ORDER BY c.country;

-- Q2: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country.
WITH country_genre_counts AS (
    SELECT c.country, g.name AS genre_name, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
    FROM customer c
    JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    JOIN invoiceline il ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id

    SELECT country, MAX(genre_count) AS max_genre_count
    FROM country_genre_counts
    GROUP BY country
)
SELECT cgc.country, cgc.genre_name
FROM country_genre_counts cgc
JOIN max_genre_per_country mgpc ON cgc.country = mgpc.country
WHERE cgc.genre_count = mgpc.max_genre_count
ORDER BY cgc.country;

-- Q3: Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country.
WITH country_top_spenders AS (
    SELECT c.country, c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(i.total) AS total_spent
    FROM customer c
    JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.country, c.first_name, c.last_name
),
max_spend_per_country AS (
    SELECT country, MAX(total_spent) AS max_spent
    FROM country_top_spenders
    GROUP BY country
)
SELECT cts.country, cts.first_name, cts.last_name, cts.total_spent
FROM country_top_spenders cts
JOIN max_spend_per_country mspc ON cts.country = mspc.country
WHERE cts.total_spent = mspc.max_spent
ORDER BY cts.country;
