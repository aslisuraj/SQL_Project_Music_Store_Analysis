# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
**Project Description:** 
In this project, I have utilized SQL queries to analyze a music store database. The database contains information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, and invoices. By applying SQL queries to this dataset, I have extracted valuable insights related to sales, customer behavior, popular genres, top customers, and more.
